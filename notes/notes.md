1. Learning neo4j for bioinformatics

### Notes on neo4j for bio

Going through the neo4j setup on auradb.

I should learn self hosted with docker, but for now using the free tier in the cloud is fine.

Goal to get neo4j setup. Learn the basics. Then shove any biology based dataset in there. Then decide some data science tasks after. But for now just get some data in there!

neo4j is super cool!

How do they handle properties?
